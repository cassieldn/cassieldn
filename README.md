# 👋 Hi there, I'm Cassandra

🎓 I'm a Computing undergrad passionate about building digital tools that are *accessible, intuitive, and empowering*.  
💡 I enjoy working on automation, UX design, and emerging tech — especially anything that helps people adopt new technologies with confidence.  
🌍 My mission? Making innovation more human-centered and inclusive.

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools I Use
- Languages: HTML · CSS · Bash · Python (learning!)  
- Tools: Git & GitHub · Figma · Visual Studio Code · Adobe XD  
- Interests: Automation · Digital Adoption · AI · Inclusive Design

## 🧪 Projects in Progress

## ✨ Fun Fact
Outside of tech, I’m all about games, good design, and turning ideas into things that *actually help people*.

Let’s build things that make a difference. 🚀
